# “Decent” or not “decent”, is that the question ?

## "Technology is the answer. But what is the question ?"

Previous case studies have shown that its less a question of decentralization or centralization but more about the governance \(i.e. how the rules of system are built and operated\) of hybrid information-energy infrastructures. Then, instead of dividing the system into 3 conventional silos, i.e. centralized, decentralized and distributed systems, 3 main verticals can be drawn \(considering energy and information as horizontals\) as a reading grid of the future of energy infrastructures :

* **Spatial & Temporal Scales**
* **Usages** 
* **Governance**

What does such a reading grid brings over a cent./decent./distrib. world view ? It help to explore that world while not pretending that it is homogeneous and fixed. In other words, while dealing with complex and interrelated hybrid systems such as the information-energy couple, it is difficult to state if the system is centralized or decentralized. Indeed, would you say that an energy system in which renewable energy production is distributed on a territory \(energy\) but operated by one company through centralized management \(information\) is centralized or decentralized ?

As a consequence, the question is less about centralization or decentralization of energy \(production, transmission, distribution, consumption\) but more about the structure of the governance of energy, and more particularly the governance of information-infrastructure couple in the energy sector. The analogy with the telecommunication sector helps to think the stakes and the trends in the energy sector : who governs the pipe and who controls what’s flowing in the pipe ?  

> **Then, decentralization is the answer; but what was the question ?**
## **Why scales matter ?**

Energy is embracing a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, related to its usage, to the needs of the various stakeholders taking part along the value chain, to the physical, economical and political constraints and to the state of technologies and techniques.

### **From really short term to the longer term**

While dealing with energy, time scale ranges from instantaneous to thousands of years: electricity balance between production and consumption must be maintained in real time at anytime, while nuclear waste, resulting in the use of nuclear material for energy production, would have an impact[ thousand of years ahead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioactive_waste).

The following table shows the range of timescales in the energy sector, which stakeholder is impacted and the level of importance of the timescale depending on the prism your looking through.

|  | **Short term** | **Medium term** | **Long terme** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Timeframe** | from infra-seconds to days | from months to years | from dozens of years to centuries |
| **What’s impacted ?** | Electricity grid management | Technology, organisation and governance | Infrastructure, nature and humans |
| **from a market point of view** | **++** | **+** | **-** |
| **from a technical point of view** | **++** | **++** | **-** |
| **from a political point of view** | **-** | **++** | **+** |
| **from a climate point of view** | **-** | **-** | **++** |
| **from a natural resources point of view** | **++** | **+** | **++** |

### **From local to more global spatial scales**

Strategies in energy management and development from production to consumption while dealing with transport and distribution, depends on the scale that is addressed. It can be broken down into 7 inter-linked scales:

* the supra level \(European Union or America scale for instance\)
* the country level \(France of Chile scale for instance\)
* the territory level \(regional scale\)
* the town level \(urban or rural scale\)
* the district level
* the building level
* the device level

Energy is a political construction. For example, while before 1946 in France energy was mainly dealt with at the local level \(town and territory\), after 1946 energy was made a national matter, and as from the 90’s, supra level coordination and orientation of the European Union has impacted national energy development. Political and historic construction of the countries also strongly impact which of the scales are more important than the others. For example, while France as a strongly centralized management of energy, Germany has a far more decentralized operation of energy; while France relies on public state involvement in the operation and regulation of the energy sector, the United States or the UK, that have more liberal ways of dealing with infrastructures, mainly leave operation to the private sector.

Despite the strong context dependance, what’s to be noted is that the spatial-scale constrains the energy sectors from a political point, from a nature point and from a technical and technological point.

## **Energy usage depends on who's looking at what.**

### **From a production point of view energy is about the resources for production.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-14-55.png)

`World energy consumption from a resource point of view (Source:` [`BP Statistical Review of World Energy`](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html) `2017)`

From a production point of view, energy usage is about the primary resources use to produce energy, i.e. oil, coal, natural gas, hydro, nuclear… . It’s not a producer’s point of view but a more analytical reading of energy usage for political and economical purpose at any level. In this case, energy usage is seen through the prism of resources that are both tradable goods and political metrics to understand the past, read the present and build prevision for the future of one key component of the economic activity and social need and comfort.

### **From a consumption point of view energy is useful to something**

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-15-32.png)

`Residential electricity consumption by end use in the United States of America in 2015 (Source:` [`EIA US Energy Information Administration`](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=36412)`)`

From a consumption point of view, energy usage is useful to something that as a useful end, i.e. heat, cold, cook, lighting… . It’s not a consumer’s point of view but a more analytical reading of energy usage for political and economical purpose. In this case, energy usage is seen through the prism of end use by typologies that are relevant for political and economic metrics to understand the past, read the present and build prevision for the future of one key component of the economic activity and social need and comfort.

### **From a producer point of view energy is a good to be sold.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-15-59.png)

As a car dealer with his cars, the energy producer needs to sell his energy, but not directly to consumer \(unless he is also a provider\) but either to energy providers or operators in charge of the balance of the grid. As cars can be booked or sold directly or even, for second-hand cars, being refurbished and then sold, the electricity producers either sells his electricity in advance \(day, weeks or even months in advance\) or “as-you-go” depending on the demand. “Second-hand” energy can be considered if energy storage operators are considered as producers.

### **From a provider point of view energy is a service to be sold.**

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/aFC_niqPhoTzKexwXNAkZ-cx-TGuC8fcfpBywbIv9w2I_p_txUeEvdzIWICgjE6BKRa3KDz5aZzGCx7a4uctfMrvaY2vhE72yC-uu9aDe8nn8S3uh93n6f8OJrZ1OIKAlUlRFvn6)

The provider buys energy \(unless he is also a producer\) from one side and sell energy services from the other to consumers. He sees energy not as a good to be sold be as a service to be provide to consumers depending on their specific needs. Like a mobile operator, the energy provider sells subscription plans for energy to be provided to your home given your requirements or needs.

### **From a consumer point of view energy is a mean to the needs of everyday life.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-16-17.png)

The consumer usually does not see energy, he or she only perceive the energy from their everyday life needs: charging phones or computer, heat, cook, lighting ...

### **From a grid operator point of view it’s about ensuring grid balance.**

To prevent blackouts, grid operator must ensure the balance between production and consumption for the sake of the grid stability. Technically, imbalance entails both voltage and frequency to fluctuate while electrical systems do not tolerate fluctuations.

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-16-34.png)

### **From an economist point of view it’s about the driving forces of energy prices.**

![](../.gitbook/assets/capture-du-2018-11-16-16-17-00.png)

`U.S. levelized cost of new electricity generation - in other words the lifetime costs to produce energy divided by energy production (Source:` [`EIA`](http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm)`)`

The economists see energy through the prism of price and market. As a result, energy usage from an economist perspective is about the pricing of a commodity, based on lifetime cost and systemic vision of the cost of production, that will then be traded on markets. For instance, in the present graph, lifetime cost of energy production by mean of production are charted so as to compare from an holistic basis various case for decision making and potentially price fixing.

## **It’s not only about organisation but more about rules, goals and paradigms.**

The technical structure of the organization is usually the point of focus in industrial or technological activities : is it centralized, decentralized, distributed ?

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/1jBhSbCdk7AkeX0MYOv5BllIwCYWT18C08s_WzP45zN--qRxdgoNM-3GM46BFgoBT_Rl8KRH20qvpb-EEyzRmPAt1VgQMaF1s0KXEU9zCk9esUxi4d-oRBPgzidYRM0GxYmru63B)

* Centralized: A system with closely coupled components \(in terms of location and authority\) and relying on a few decision takers / producers / providers that then distribute from central points to decentralized or distributed points. Ex.: banks.
* Distributed: A system where components might span geographical boundaries but are owned and controlled by a few entities entity. In other words, while processes are decentralized authority, decision taking and trust are centralized. Ex.: Dropbox.
* Decentralized: A system with nodes that are geographically distributed and under the control of respective node operators. Each node is an equal amongst others within this system and hence, trust is equally distributed. This is what makes the system decentralized. Ex. a public blockchain based project like Bitcoin.

Energy does not differ much, bearing in mind that : \(1\) it’s a very complex system, \(2\) such organisation structure applies to the architecture of the system, the political organisation of the system or the logical structure of the system.

With regards to complexity though, and the changes that are being witnessed in the energy sector, it turns out that amongst the top 5 points on which it is necessary to act in order to impact a system towards significant change are listed : “**The rules of the system**”, “**The power for the system to evolve**”, “**The goals of the system**”, “**The paradigm of system**” and “**The power to transcend paradigms**” \(_Places to intervene in a system according to Meadows, Joi Ito PhD Thesis “_[_The Practice of Change_](https://web.media.mit.edu/~joi/files/ito_phd_diss_v1.11.pdf)_”, 2018_\).

As a result, while dealing with VUCA \(or TUNA\) context in such a complex system as energy, beyond the structure of the technical organisation, governance is key: who and how the rules are set ? towards which goals ? under which existing or building-up paradigms ?

_**For more details**: I strongly advise you to consider reading to read_ [_Vitalik Buterin Medium’s post about the “Meaning of decentralization”_](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274) _\(_[_https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274_](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/the-meaning-of-decentralization-a0c92b76a274)_\)._
