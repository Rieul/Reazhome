## **Energy : one of nature and civilization’s fundamentals**

Energy is often considered through its techno-economical and regulatory aspects, sometimes through its political and social construction but rather seldomly from a life perspective. Strikingly enough, or obviously stated : energy is at the basis of the universe and that is not exaggeratedly speaking.

Energy is what makes it possible for atoms to be internally stable as well as to bound with each other, or, at the opposite, to degrade and release energy. It’s what makes it possible for molecule to bind to each other; for cells to grow, live and die; for the earth to accumulate raw energy resources \(oil coal, gas, biomass…\) to support our needs and comfort …

By far, energy is the key determinant to our world, both from a human activities perspective and from the earth diversity and life view.

Take transportation for instance, without fuel cars do not run, without petroleum motorways won’t be the same; how do you run the traffic management system and, for instance, traffic lights ? You need power. What about electric vehicle ? It needs a battery pack that requires to be charge, thus necessitating electricity.

Deepening the chain dependance upstream : the car manufacturing processes run with energy that is produced by a power plant from raw materials such as coal, fuel or gas that need to be extracted from underground, thus involving the use of energy. Downstream, distributing and selling the cars also involve the use of energy.

Take the building and housing sector for instance; not only the building construction process consumes energy, but, once built, it also requires energy for its daily operation. From heating to advanced energy monitoring, using IoT \(Internet of Things\) and “smart” devices, energy impacts and its usage is impacted by the emergence of new technologies, organisational structures and potentials offered by computation democratization.

Closer to our daily life, consider:

* \(1\) the drinkable tap water that you’re able to enjoy in the vast majority of the industrial world;
* \(2\) the food you’re able to enjoy, either cooked of raw, flavoured as you like, 

They both strongly depend on energy.

In the first case you need to extract water from sources, treat it, distribute it and … treat it again if rejected as “grey-water”. In the second case you need to grow your food, process it, distribute it, cook it, eat it and … deal with food waste. At any step energy is needed.

The exponential increase in computer power \(see the [Moore’s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) : in short the computer power is doubling every 2 years\) and expansion of electronic use and digital usage \(see [the development of IoT and its security downside](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/security-center/secure-iot-proposed-framework.html) : in short the number of connected devices follows an exponential trend\) also participate in increase of energy use.

At current state, in the industrial world, and increasingly in the rest of the world, any sector of our society is energy dependant, regardless of scale, usage and governance.

Such a dependance to energy has been built over the [industrial revolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution) and in line with both local and global socio-economic-political choices. As of electricity is concerned, Figure 1 shows that there is a strong correlation between the electricity consumption \(on the right\) and the GDP evolution \(on the left\) from 1985 to 2015. In short, the more thriving the GDP based industrial economy is, the more intensive the energy use.

Over the past century, the world has became more and more complex and intertwined, [VUCA \(Volatile-Uncertain-Complex-Ambiguous\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility,_uncertainty,_complexity_and_ambiguity) the US Army would have said, or [TUNA \(Turbulent-Uncertain-Novel-Ambiguous\)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/adamgordon/2016/04/06/oxford/) Oxford research are saying. If energy is at the center of the driving forces of both our society and daily lives, it is also strongly interdepedant from all the other sectors, building up what can called a “complex system”. To operate in such a complexity, information is key. and it’s the energy counterpart of life and the functioning of our civilization and daily life.

## **Information : the energy counterpart of life**

![Structure Of DNA](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/PuLmyQqL3FFnUK1QGibE5XMlcivPnJXNKh2pskXcT4EEScOcKbVdIzrm-rM-VyIPK__7SGQgB9NApql6xTQKMwn4Rhqle9pwiExqaV0I--VIvekxRGGfpfR2GAPwjF-ZK-wZ52tb)

Like energy, information is usually viewed through economic and strategic prisms or as a basis for learning \(acquiring knowledge and know-how\) and acting in the world. More fundamentally, information is the basis of life structure, organization of the world and development of civilizations.

From DNA as an information base for life to pheromones that helps ants to find their ways, not to mentioned how bees and birds can orient themselves while using the various signal they’re able to catch; or even how humans can understand, communicate, share and trade together and with non-human and artificial agents; information is the counterpart of energy as a fundamental for life and a key determinant to our activities development.

While considering transportation, not only is the infrastructure governed by information but the car itself is driven by and drives more and more information. On one hand, it thus concerns traffic on the road, statistics and usage model to predict pics or valleys in the use of cars, as well as about the weather or local, national or international event for instance. All those mentioned parameters are impacting transport and vice versa, consequently information provided by as well as provided information to the system helps to operate it

On the other hand, the development of micro-electronic combined with increased computation power has made cars an increasing source of information. Take a Tesla, more than a car, its a running powerful computer with onboard Artificial Intelligence able to learn from the both the environment and the driver.

A less stunning example but much more structuring has been the development of GPS \(Global Positioning System\) and its use either in car’s onboard softwares and in specific GPS devices or through smartphone democratization, making the information providers \(i.e. Coyote, Apple or Google\) key players in the traffic operation. They then become mobility operators since they have the power to gather, process and use the information.

The same trend can be witnessed in the building sector, not only from the perspective of monitoring and the use of IoT to operate the building – which is not new and related to the domotic trend - but also, at a more refined and dispersed level, from the point of view of managing everyday inhabitants life in the building with more and more capable assisting technologies such as Google Home, Alexas, connected fridges, home smart thermostat…

**`Google devices suite for connected home (from Google website)`**

One conventional case linking information and energy in the building sector is the heat management system for instance. Take [Nest](https://nest.com/fr/), the « smart » heat management system from Google; such a device management system is not only an automated thermostat but it learns from habits to adjust to behavior. In other words, Google is collecting information from the Nest device on the inhabitants’ heating habits, process it through learning algorithms \(Artificial Intelligence\) so that it’s able to learn and predict the inhabitants behavior. Beyond heat management however, more structuring dynamics are on their way with the democratization of “smart meters” that are able to collect and discriminate information about any commodity usage \(energy, water, food, air…\). What’s interesting though, in addition to the specificity of each sector regarding its relation to data and information, is the systemic vision of the information life cycle from sector to sector, particularly while dealing with multi-sector global companies for whom information is the entry point.

As stated for energy, at current state, in the industrial world and increasingly in the rest of the world, any sector of our society is information dependant, regardless of the scale, the usage and the governance.

## **Where energy and information meet : the case of electricity.**

If yesterday’s energy production, transmission, distribution and provision were mainly centralized \(relying on a centralized management of information\), democratization of digital tools, relocalization of production and automation and autonomy provided by increasing computational power help switching towards new organization in the energy chain. However, numerous futures can be drawn through such an observation.

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/vietPKNKiXcH3Pz7XjfJZOgAlfSN2fGjL9qG6PN8Jy2gPu6TY1MH7APR9kCmv7RkcIaA-p98WTTNA2lrRFSVxvUVL6HvPeU_-UMIxfOSU1m6oemww47tPqQAcOre5W7-6Cxs4FOf)

On one hand, if use of digital tools is becoming mainstream, governance of the digital information \(data\) is usually centralized and locked. Yet, for the distribution to smoothly work both ways while connecting distributed transmission networks that drive electricity from abundant and various sources to consumers’ homes while « ignoring boundaries », access to information necessitate full interoperation if not openness. On the other hand, fully distributed energy ecosystem can be drawn from observation of current emergences for the future of infrastructure.

Let’s take the Musk's industries vision for instance - with respect to the industries Elon Musk has been involved in - as an example of where energy and information meet and to what end.

![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/mE4wk7Gu2Z_YamrcGdGh7fslcOHgSpOVMk9SOSqelbphnm1HMQLK-XUz-1V4vgro59WPFjdUlVM7qbr0q1A753GZZYXw4wqBwCtaVoKqOOHw7Cw9ghTATGW5KRQiB2EiZwY9ZKKt)

In short, there are 3 layers in the Musk’s vision of the future of energy in which Tesla is a pivotal point :

* first : electricity can be locally and individually produced anywhere from solar power \(SolarCity\);
* second : batteries can be used both at large scale and local scale ; on one side to provide system services to grid, on the other side so sustain electricity consumption while sun is not shining \(Tesla Energy through Powerwalls\);
* third : electric cars with batteries in them act as an electricity distribution system from point A to point B while considering that the electric car can be an electricity provider for the home \(Tesla through electric vehicles in combination with Powerwalls\).

From the interoperation of those layers, Musk proposes a fully distributed energy system vision where :

* large scale grids are responsible for balance through responsive systems;
* electricity is produced locally and stored if necessary to sustain consumption;
* electricity is moved as « packs of energy » from point A to point B with car;
* operation and management of the system are multiple, from homes to cars that are literally localized and moving supercomputers, and interoperable.

**`Powerwall - Tesla energy management App : managing power from car to home to grid.`**

If we consider going into details with the other core activities of the Musk industries, namely space with SpaceX, high speed underground transportation with Hyperloop and the Boring Company in charge of digging the tunnels, artificial intelligence with OpenAI, and brain-machine interfaces with Neuralink, such a vision of distributed, automated and autonomous system grows in importance while addressing fundamental and interrelated core fields of our societies. The key relation point to those activities are Energy and Information.

It appears that the convergence of increased potential for decentralized energy production, use of highly distributed IoT or digital devices infrastructure providing information and the constant increase in computing power brings uncertainty rather than a determined vision of the world while trying to guess the future of energy. One of the best way to address a VUCA - or TUNA - world is to experiment and test typologies of organization in various context.
